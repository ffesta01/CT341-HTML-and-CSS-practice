        <h1>The Ocean</h1>
      </header>
    
      <p> <b>The ocean is a huge body of saltwater that covers about 71 percent of Earth’s surface.</b> The planet has one global ocean, though oceanographers and the countries of the world have traditionally divided it into four distinct regions: the <b>Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, and Arctic oceans.</b> Beginning in the 20th century, some oceanographers labeled the seas around Antarctica the Southern Ocean, and in 2021 National Geographic officially recognized this fifth ocean. </p>
 
      <p> <b>An estimated 97 percent of the world’s water is found in the ocean.</b> Because of this, the ocean has considerable impact on weather, temperature, and the food supply of humans and other organisms. Despite its size and impact on the lives of every organism on Earth, the ocean remains a mystery. More than 80 percent of the ocean has never been mapped, explored, or even seen by humans. A far greater percentage of the surfaces of the moon and the planet Mars has been mapped and studied than of our own ocean floor.</p>
      
    <p>It is unknown how many different species call the ocean their home. With many marine ecosystems suffering from rising sea temperatures, pollution, and other problems, some oceanographers believe the number of species is dropping. Still, there may be many positive surprises awaiting oceanographers in the years ahead. <b>It could be that more than 90 percent of the ocean’s species are still undiscovered, with some scientists estimating that there are anywhere between a few hundred thousand and a few million more to be discovered. Currently, scientists know of around 226,000 ocean species.</b></p>
    
    <p>Learning more about the seafloor and the rest of the ocean is the passion of <b>National Geographic Explorer Marcello Calisti.</b> He is a biorobotics expert who is developing an undersea exploration vehicle that uses “legged locomotion,” inspired by the way an octopus moves under water. His long-range goal is to design robots that can explore the depths that are difficult for humans to reach.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_page"> <b>Read More</a></p>
